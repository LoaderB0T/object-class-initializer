# Object Class Initializer

Demo repo for using an anonymous class as an object initializer in TypeScript.

## Motivation 💥

Create an object using an anonymous class to access the 'object' during its initialization. It's 6 lines of code, you might want to just copy paste this instead of installing this package, but who am I to judge?

## Built With 🔧

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
